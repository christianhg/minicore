# minicore

The goal of this repository is to figure out how to build an app with webpack that has the following proporties:

* There exists a common core.
* There exists a number of plugins that all can import functionality from the core.
* The plugins can also import functionality from each other.
* The core resides in `./src/core` and the plugins reside in `./src/plugins/**`.
* The core and each plugin should be outputted as its own bundle with no duplication, i.e. their bundle should only inlide their own code.

```
src
â”œâ”€â”€ core
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ compute
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ curry
â””â”€â”€ plugins
    â”œâ”€â”€ add (imports from core)
    â”œâ”€â”€ bar (imports from foo)
    â”œâ”€â”€ foo (imports from core as well as add and subtract)
    â””â”€â”€ subtract (imports from core)
```

* The naive, plain solution is in `webpack.config.naive.js`.
* The desired solution is in `webpack.config.commons.js`.

## Useful commands:

Distribute and analyse the compact version of the naive build:

```
npm run analyse-naive-compact
```

Distribute and analyse the compact version of the desired build:

```
npm run analyse-commons-compact
```
